# iFrame Wallet

This wallet is not a browser extension.

This is an experimental new type of cryptographic wallet itended to be embedded in an iFrame in the parent website (as opposed to the typical way that it's in a browser extension).

## Background

When a wallet is in a browser extension, there are many use restrictions for developers and barriers to entry for new userss:

Developers must

- work around extension globals injected
- itegrate each wallet
- only offer a list of preselected wallet options to their users
- more integration work when a new wallet if offered

To adopt the current wallet model, users must:

- have a browser that can be extended (no mobile?)
- must _want_ to download & install (ugh, I have to install something? Really?)
- _actually_ download and install
- choose only from app-chosen wallets, instead of their own
- work within the chosen wallet capabilities (many wallets don't offer encryption or key type options)

So since we have barriers to adoption and dev limitations, we can look at another way.

What if the wallet was just a website? Not just any website, but a website:

- with miminal or zero javascript dependencies (to minimize XSS risk)
- configurable, so user could choose to use their own wallet
- hostable from content verifiable sources, such as IPFS (content identifiable)
- hostable from sandboxable sources, such as Deno
- Zero barrier to entry (no download)
- Portable to mobile
- extensible by devs and users (add your own CSS, confirmation components, anything)

Then perhaps we could have greater adoption and get this Web3 thing really rolling?

## Install

```
npm install @douganderson444/iframe-wallet
```

## Usage

```
npm run dev
```

## Dev Notes

To add a (Svelte) confirmation Components to a crypto method handler:

```js
let confirmed = await get(confirm)('<method.name.path>', origin);
```

Where `<method.name.path>` is something like `'connect'` or `'sign'` or `'arweaveWalletAPI.sign'`.

To add a custom confirmation component:

1. Create the custom component
2. Wrap Custom component in `$lib/handlers/DefaultConfirmation.svelte`
3. Import the Custom Confirm component and inject logic to `src\lib\handlers\confirm\index.ts`

```js
let customizedComponents = {
	connect: { component: Connect }  // existing custom confirm component
	<namespace>: {
		<methodName>: {
			component: <CustomComponentName>
		}
	}
};
```

Don't add any JavaScript dependencies unless you absolutely have to, we're trying to minimize any chance of attacks. Rust+ Wasm would be preferred. Otherwise Issues and PRs accepted.
